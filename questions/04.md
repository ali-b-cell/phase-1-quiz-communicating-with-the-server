# Fetch

Yuli is making an application that interacts with a Pokemon API which uses JSON
as its response format. Assuming that Yuli has created a variable `URL`that
contains the correct API endpoint to fetch a single Pokemon instance, Which of
the following code snippets would send a request to the API then log a Pokemon
object to the console?

## Correct

```javascript
fetch(URL)
  .then((resp) => resp.json())
  .then((pokemon) => console.log(pokemon));
```

> Correct!

## Incorrect

```javascript
fetch(URL)
  .then((resp) => resp.text())
  .then((pokemon) => console.log(pokemon));
```

> Not quite. In the first `.then` method, using `.text()` on the response will
> pass a string of text to the next `.then` rather than a Pokemon object.

## Incorrect

```javascript
fetch(URL).then((pokemon) => console.log(pokemon));
```

> Not quite. In the `.then` method, we'll have access to the raw response object,
> which has a JSON-formatted string in the body. How can we convert that JSON
> string to a JavaScript object?

## Incorrect

I don't know
