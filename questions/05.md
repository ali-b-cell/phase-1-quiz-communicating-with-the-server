# Sending Data with Fetch

We can send additional data in a request by using the `body` option when
calling`fetch`. What code would you need to write next to the `body` option in
the`configurationObject` to send the `formData` object to the server in the
example below?

```javascript
const formData = {
  dogName: "Byron",
  dogBreed: "Poodle",
};

const configurationObject = {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Accept: "application/json",
  },
  body: ________ ,
};

fetch("http://localhost:3000/dogs", configurationObject);
```

## Correct

JSON.stringify(formData)
