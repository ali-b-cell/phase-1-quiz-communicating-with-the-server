# Fetch

Yuli is making an application that interacts with the
[Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co). The Pokemon API uses JSON as its response
format. Which of the following code snippets would allow her to send a request
to the API and log a Pokemon object to the console?

## Correct

```js
fetch("https://pokeapi.co/")
  .then((resp) => resp.json())
  .then((pokemon) => console.log(pokemon));
```

> Correct!

## Incorrect

```js
fetch("https://pokeapi.co/")
  .then((resp) => resp.text())
  .then((pokemon) => console.log(pokemon));
```

> Not quite. In the first `.then` method, using `.text()` on the response will
> pass a string of text to the next `.then` rather than a Pokemon object.

## Incorrect

```js
fetch("https://pokeapi.co/").then((pokemon) => console.log(pokemon));
```

> Not quite. In the `.then` method, we'll have access to the raw response
> object, which has a JSON-formatted string in the body. How can we convert that
> JSON string to a JavaScript object?

## Incorrect

I don't know
